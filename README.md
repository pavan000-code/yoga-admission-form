This is a Django project for Yoga Admission form.

I have Used Crispy Forms for creating the front end part and for backend i have used dbsqlite.

to run the code you have to enter the following command in the terminal which is directed in the file location.
"py manage.py runserver"

you have to preinstall the following libraries:

"pip install django"


"pip install django-crispy-forms"



"pip install crispy"


after running the code open your browser anbd click for localhost following with the port specified.

to view the data that the user has to run the code and has to click the following in the browser

"localhost:port/admin/"

this will take you to the backend of the file

you can view and edit your changes to the data there.


to stop the server from running just press "ctrl+c" in the terminal.
